An exercise in Python, this project consists of two separate parts: PyBank and PyPoll. 

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this challenge, a Python script is created to analyze the financial records of a dummy company. The data set can be found at [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) and is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The Python script analyzes the records to calculate:

  * Total number of months included in the dataset

  * Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of these changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


* In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* This challenge is an exercise in helping a fictional small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* Using Python, a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) is analyzed. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. The Python script created analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * Total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * Percentage of votes each candidate won

  * Total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, the final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
